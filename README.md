Adventure Game

I designed a game with 4 different battlefields, 1 safe house and a shop that buys weapons and armor.

In this game, our player determines the character he/she will play by choosing one of 3 different classes with different damage, health and money.

When we go to his safe house, our player's health is restored.

When he goes to the tool store, he can buy one of 3 weapons of different powers and/or one of the shields with 3 different protection levels with the money he earns from monsters.

There are obstacles specific to that region in the war zones and the player must fight them.

When the player kills the obstacles here, he earns money equal to their value.

If the player defeats all the obstacles in the forest, cave and river, he wins the special rewards there and wins the game when he returns to the safe house.

After entering these regions and winning the region reward, they cannot enter that region again.

If he runs out of health when fighting his enemies, he dies and the game ends.

When it encounters a obstacle, it has a 50% chance of hitting the obstacle or the player and the game continues until one of them dies.

The fourth region, the mine, is different from the other regions.

The player can enter the mine area as many times as he wants, there are no restrictions because that area does not have a special reward.

Obstacles in the mine can earn money, weapons or armor depending on luck when they are killed.
